## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many individuals, particularly in rural and low-income groups, lack financial literacy, making them vulnerable to digital fraud and mismanagement. This AI agent aims to bridge that gap by offering an easy-to-use, multilingual platform for digital finance education.

## 👥 End Users
- General public (especially rural and semi-urban populations)
- Students and young adults
- Senior citizens
- Small vendors and business owners

1. User submits a question in their preferred language (e.g., “How to use UPI?”)
2. The system retrieves content from verified sources (RBI, NPCI, banks, etc.)
3. The AI model (RAG with IBM Granite) processes the data
4. A personalized and understandable response is returned

## 📈 Future Scope
- Voice-enabled support
- Integration with regional schemes and subsidies
- Offline access via SMS/USSD
- Financial goal tracking and reminders
